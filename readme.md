# GIO

## A Browser-based memory game

This is a simple musical memory based game. The goal is to mimic the sequence that is randomly generated on one octave of the piano üéπ. Start the game, and see how far you can go with the randomly generated arpeggio! Good luck, have fun!

This game is named after Gio the cat, one of the sweetest and most dapper cats to wear pants. Arpeggio by name, Gio for short. He was a good dude and a music lover too. His melodies are random, chaotic and sometimes sugary. May you find inspiration in his pianic pluckings.

### Instructions:

* Press **Go!** to start the sequence. üöÄ  

* The sequence will start with one note on the piano. Play that same note by clicking on the piano key.

* The sequence will then play the same note, followed by a new note.

* Mimic the sequence by clicking each note in order on the piano. 

* The sequence will continue adding one new note after each turn

* Continue to mimic the sequence to see how far you can go!

* If you fail to replay the exact sequence, the game will end üíÄ

* Press **Go!** to start again!
